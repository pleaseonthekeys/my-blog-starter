Tomorrow I am saying my final goodbyes to dear friends, close enough to be family and flying out of SFO to land in Connecticut. I will have a month and a half before moving into my new apartment in The East Village then starting Hack Reactor.

## What's to miss about Santa Cruz, California

###### Allured by the deluge of jasmine clusters
###### citrus blossoms, ferns, redwoods, moss.
###### Most enchanting bioluminescent
###### Bipedal trails in the midnight sand
###### Spirals 'round a kayak paddle and gasping mouths.
###### Monarchs bead every branch of November.
###### Nose-diving brown pelicans
###### Plummeting cormorants
###### Cliff-dwelling swallows framing the frolic of flirtatious dolphins.
###### Delighting in every wonder with you, you, you and especially you.

## Last week was the first time I: pushed a project to [GitHub](http://www.github.com)

I love having mentors. I'm delighted by having someone to cheer me on, challenge me, and share in celebration of small successes. After following some on-line instructions to push my blog project to GitHub and failing to see results, I called on my friend, Lizzie, who was in the same place as me, technically, just three years ago. I really like how after teaching me a lesson, we'll run through the process again and before I take an action, she asks, "what do you expect to happen?" This is a question I am making a habit of asking myself because it can be so easy to just roll through the steps of doing something without actually understanding what's happening. Here's how I finally got the project pushed:
 - open Command line terminal
 - ran cd my-blog-starter
 - ran git add . (add . adds all changes to the project rather than just individual ones)
 - ran git commit
 - added a commit comment when the vim screen appeared after running git commit
 - pressed the escape key then :wq to save the comment and exit vim (a text editor used on the command line)
 - ran git push
 - ran git log and reviewed commits to make sure the task was accomplished

 task: ask another mentor, about the shortcut notation for running commit and adding the commit message in the same line.

## How I'm deploying this site: [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)

Netlify's platform packages many tools for building and deploying sites- many of which I don't quite understand yet. What I do understand is that netlify is great for connecting a project to a GitHub project and have it automatically deploy with commits.  I ran into some problems attempting to use [Surge](https://surge.sh). I followed [Gatsby Instructions](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/deploying-to-surge/) and successfully obtained a url, but ran into trouble when trying to get subsequent deploys to send to the same location.

## Most Common Acronym this week: CDN

Content Delivery Network - a system of distributed servers (network) that deliver webpages and other Web content to a user based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage and a content delivery server.

## An inspiring broadcast I heard this week: [1A with Joshua Johnson- Peak Performance: Inside The World Of Super Athletes](https://the1a.org/shows/2019-06-24/peak-performance-inside-the-world-of-super-athletes)

Mantra: "I can do hard things"
