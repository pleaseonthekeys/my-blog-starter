## A VSCode Plugin: [Quokka](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode)

This plug-in is a fantastic way to view your code's output as you're biulding it. As long as you're file is not using code that references any other files, console.log your outputs at the bottom of your file and watch the results appear as you are typing, directly in the editor, then return final results in VSCode's console.

Also, this is what a non-VSCode Quokka looks like:

## A Place to Store Stuff: Very Brief Intro to Data Structures and Classes
So, you can store things right in here: { }, or here if you'd like: [ ]. These cute little boxes provide a storage unit for data and the complex behaviors that can organize, access, manipulate, and deliver data to make it useful. In Javascript, classes are functions that can be used to generate Data Structures and their methods. The kinds of choices engineers make in regards to the data structures they choose to use and the syntax (or style) of their class depend on circumstances like: familiarity across languages, the "time and space" required to perform the algorithms, and use cases for each structure. Since the purpose of this blog is aimed towards beginners, to start this topic, I suggest gaining a thorough understanding of the terms:
  * Class Instantiation Patterns (described as the 5th topic)
    * Functional
    * Functional-Shared
    * Prototypal
    * Pseudoclassical
  * Algorithms in JavaScript 
  * Time Complexity
  * Space Complexity
  * Big-O Notation (introduce as 4th topic)
  * Data Structures like: 
    * Hash Tables
    * Trees (As a Data Structure)
    * Linked Lists (singly and doubly linked)
    * Binary Search Trees

## A Way to Stay Functional(): Stop being Scared to Ask Questions
This week, I learned to get over an apparent fear of asking questions. I always identified as someone who asked smart questions; however, this week's experience taught me to take that to a whole other level. There is literally no time to linger in a state of "not knowing". From here forward, if I don't know something, and have spent a specific amount of time trying to uncover the answer myself, I will immediately flag someone for help. My cohort is full of very energetic, bright, and kind people. I will go to them first then approach the energetic, bright, and incredibly helpful Hackers in Residence. The main takeaway here is that there is no time. Just keep moving forward and immediately banish unhelpful fears.

## A Quick Guide to Analyzing the Complexity of Algorithmic Approaches: Big-O
At its simplest, Big-O is a tool for analyzing and communicating the complexity of the solutions to software engineering problems. This [Big-O Cheat Sheet](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/) provides a look up table for various algorithms best and worst case time and space complexities. If you have never encountered this tool, check out this [Introduction to Big-O video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6xkbGLQesk).

## Hop on the [Coding Train] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw)
Currently, I am taking a deep dive into [Object Oriented Programming](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bb7z2IJaTlzwzIg_5yvL4i) in order to grasp classes and data structures; however, I also followed this channel and watched JavaScript intro videos when I was **first** starting to learn to code. Daniel Shiffman is a very charismatic and relatable teacher. The interface is colorful and the quality of Daniel's delivery creates a very enjoyable learning experience! Where ever you are on your learning path, hop on the Coding Train!!
