I linked this right to the map of locations around the world, because you'll definitely want that.

## A concept that was hard for me to wrap my head around (but will show up all the time moving forward):
I know, I know, this will probably be one of those cringe worthy posts in about a month, when I realize that I just made a detailed post about, like, "How to Walk on Grass", by Lauren Albert. However, this noe is for all of my baby coder friends out there!

Checking to see if something already exists inside a loop before taking action on it, so as to prevent overwriting (see groupBy)

**Here’s how groupBy finally worked (in plain English)**

**First** I declared an empty object because our return value should end up as an object.

**Then** I iterated over the collection using a forEach loop.

The function inside of the forEach loop went as follows:
	declare a variable named groupType
		(because each key will be organized by a group type essentially extracted by the predicate function argument called with groupBy() )

	**create two if-else blocks**
		1. (Besides syntax, this made sense to me intuitively)
		 if the type of the predicate argument is a string, then the groupType variable would be set to equal the item[predicate], in other words, an array or string property called on each item.
			This is not to be confused with item.predicate - which is looking for a property var item = {predicate: ‘something’}
			And also not to be confused with item[‘predicate’] which the interpreter thinks isn a string literal called ‘predicate’
			I’m not used to calling array properties in bracket notation so I didn’t realize this could be done.
		else the groupType variable would be set to equal the predicate function wrapped around each item passed through the loop, predicate(item)

		2. (This was the if-else block that threw me and felt totally counter intuitive until my friend, Lizzie brought it to my attention, thus the whole point of the post)
		**if** the object key exists then we know the value is an array and we should push each new item in to that key’s array value - remember, the key was generated by the predicate.
		**why?** Because if it does exist, we need to make sure we don’t just keep creating new arrays that overwrite each other every time we iterate over a new item!

		**else if** the key does not exist, create a place for it by setting groupObj[groupType] equal to an empty array then pushing that new item into that array.
		next time around in the forEach loop, when the interpreter looks for this key, it will exist! In which case, it will choose the if section of this second block.

	when the forEach loop has finished it’s rounds, close that function out without a return statement

	**finally**, return the groupObj.

## An Alternative to Mac's Terminal: [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)
iTerm2 claims that it is a, "...terminal emulator for macOS that does amazing things." While I have not spent much time in mac's terminal, my momma taught me that if you're going to *really* do something, get the best tools for the thing. I've heard rumors from people I trust, plus here's a [sneak peak at some proof](https://www.iterm2.com/features.html).
### A cool trick in iTerm2: Quadruple click
In iTerm2 a quadruple click knows what you’re trying to highlight, like email addresses, URLs, filename, etc!  In other contexts outside of iTerm, a quad click highlights all. I just never realized that I could click more than once or twice for anything useful. Surprise!
